# University Dropout Prediction System

## Background
This project addresses the critical challenge of university student dropout, which affects nearly one-third of students worldwide. Traditional methods often identify at-risk students too late for effective intervention. Our solution provides early detection using actual academic data to help students before they reach crisis points.

## Overview
A user-friendly web application that predicts student dropout risk using machine learning. The system analyzes historical patterns to identify students needing support 6-12 months in advance, enabling timely interventions that can save academic careers.

## What the System Analyzes
The application considers multiple student factors to assess risk:

**Academic Performance:**
- Grades from first and second semesters
- Courses passed vs courses attempted
- Attendance and participation patterns

**Personal & Financial Situation:**
- Scholarship and financial aid status
- Tuition payment history
- Family background and support factors

**University Experience:**
- Course load and academic pressure
- Adaptation to university life
- Progress toward degree completion

## Key Benefits

**For Students:**
- Early detection of academic challenges
- Personalized support recommendations
- Higher chances of successful graduation

**For Universities:**
- 93% accurate risk identification
- Potential to save 300+ students annually
- Significant financial savings from improved retention
- Better allocation of support resources

## How to Use
The web application provides instant risk assessments by simply entering student information. Results include clear risk categories (low/medium/high) and specific action plans for each level of need.

## Results That Matter
- **93% accuracy** in predicting student outcomes
- **32% dropout rate** reduced through early interventions
- **14.94:1 return on investment** for implementing institutions
- **6-12 month early warning** for at-risk students

This tool represents a practical approach to student success, transforming reactive support into proactive care that benefits both students and educational institutions.
